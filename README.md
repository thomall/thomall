## Greetings visitors :wave: :wave:

I am currently working as a research assistant at a local community college, where I work on a wide range of projects involving [GIS][link_gi] and [Remote Sensing][link_rs]. Many of these projects (including the most interesting ones) involve a degree of confidentiality, so I am unfortunately unable to share them, though I can offer an overview of the technologies involved in our other works. Over the last few years I've had the opportunity to work on many projects involving collecting, processing, and analysing [lidar][link_li] data and remotely sensed imagery. In one of my favorites so far, I had the opportunity to develop our own lidar collection platform. When in-season, drones often find their way into our workflows for data collection. Sensor deployment to monitor study areas is common as well, with one of our most recent suite of deployments involving a piece of equipment known as an [ADCP][link_ad].

When I'm not working, I like to spend time on my own personal projects creating things and writing scripts to further my skills in my hobbies. This includes, but is certainly not limited to baking :cake:, gardening :seedling:, and music :musical_score:. Arduino projects in particular have taken my interest as of late, and I am currently working on a temperature, humidity, and light-controlled box for seed germination. Something like this is useful for seeds for plants that can give you trouble if you live somewhere that's still cold when it's time to start sprouting, and especially useful when trying to germinate seeds for rarer and more valuable plants. I look forward to sharing this project here when it is ready so that other people can build their own version.
